# MBA-Admissions-A-Logistic-Regression-Approach
## Introduction;
Deciding to pursue an MBA is a big step for many aspiring business leaders. In this project, I will be diving into synthetic data generated from the Wharton Class of 2025's statistics to explore what factors might influence admission decisions. This dataset includes a range of variables like gender, race, GPA, GMAT scores, and work experience, which can provide some interesting insights into the admissions process.
Through this analysis, I will be looking at some key questions, such as:
•	How do admission rates differ among various demographic groups?
•	What impact do academic metrics like GPA and GMAT scores have on whether someone gets admitted?
•	Does work experience play a role in the decision-making process?
•	What are some identifiable relationships between the variables in the dataset?
